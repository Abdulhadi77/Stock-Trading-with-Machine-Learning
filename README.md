# Stock-Trading-with-Machine-Learning
Have you ever wondered if AI could earn tremendous amount of money on the stock market and outsmart other human investors? An AI-powered trading robot can automatically make trade decisions on your behalf and allow you to profit from the market without your direct involvement.

we’ll start by developing an application that reads price data from an API and saves it on a MongoDB database. 
Another part of this application will be using the saved data for training a machine learning model, optimizing, and then saving it. 
The last part will be using the saved model and applying it to real-time data provided by the brokerage company while trying to predict the stock price movements. It’s that exciting!
